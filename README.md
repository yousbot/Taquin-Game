# Taquin Game Resolution - Archived

[![Archived](https://img.shields.io/badge/Archived-Yes-red.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/taquin-game-resolution/archive/master.zip)

This project, now archived, is an example of resolving the Taquin game using an AI class-based heuristic tree. The selection of moves is based on the sum of distances separating each point from the goal configuration.

## Purpose

The Taquin game, also known as the sliding puzzle, is a classic problem in artificial intelligence. This project serves as an educational example of how to approach and solve such a puzzle using heuristics and tree-based algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `taquin.py`: The Python code implementing the Taquin game resolution.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the archived project from the [master.zip](https://github.com/yourusername/taquin-game-resolution/archive/master.zip) link.

2. Extract the project files to your desired location.

3. Open `taquin.py` in a Python-compatible environment or text editor.

4. Modify the `L_in` and `L_Out` variables to represent your Taquin puzzle input and desired output configurations.

5. Run the script to see how the Taquin puzzle is resolved using the heuristic tree-based approach.
